# ML Classification Algorithms

The goal of this project for the Machine Learning course at NTUA is the familiarization with Machine Learning classification algorithms. The project is divided into two parts, each with its own Jupyter Notebook.

## Installation
> I assume that Python and Jupyter are already installed :grinning:

Clone the repository 
```bash
  git clone https://github.com/aimiliospot/ML-Homework-1.git
```

Create and activate virtual environment (on Windows)
```bash
  python -m venv virtualenv

  virtualenv\Scripts\activate (Windows)
```

Create and activate virtual environment (on Linux)
```bash
  python -m venv virtualenv

  source virtualenv/bin/activate (Linux)
```

Install the dependecies:
```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

Use `part1.ipynb` and `part2.ipynb` notebook
